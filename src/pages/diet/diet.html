      <li>Infants should be breastfed <b>exclusively</b> during the <b>first 6 months</b> of life.</li>
      <li>Infants should be breastfed <b>continuously</b> until 2 years of age and beyond.</li>

      <li>At least <b>400g</b> of fruits and vegetables a day.</li>
      <li>Less than 10% of total energy intake from free sugars which is equivalent to 50g (or around 12 level teaspoons) for a person of healthy body weight consuming approximately 2000 calories per day, but ideally less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits</li>
